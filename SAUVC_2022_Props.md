# SAUVC 2022 Props

This documents covers what props were used for SAUVC 2022 and how they were made.

The parts were purchased from Sun Hee Hardware store, Decathlon (floats and inflatable flare), and Daiso (floats). 

## Qualification Arena(s)
3 Qualification Gates of 150cm wide and ~100cm long were erected. 

Parts required:
- 6 x 40mm diameter x 100cm long pipes
- 6 x 40mm diameter PVC tees
- 3 x 40mm diameter x 150cm long pipes
- 6 x 40mm diameter end caps
- 30m nylon striped rope
- 6 x diver weights 
- Cable ties
- Floats (Daiso) 

Instructions to assemble:
1. Fit the 6 PVC tees onto the 100cm long pipes and glue them together using PVC glue. 
2. Drill two holes on the base of each 100cm long pipes. These will be used for attaching dive weights during actual deployment. 
3. Fit the 6 end caps onto the 3 units of 150cm long pipes. Glue them using PVC glue and ensure they are watertight. 
4. String the nylon rope through the tees. 
5. Position the tees at alternate dive lanes, with two tees within 150cm of each other. Keep them in place by putting floats on either side of the tees.
